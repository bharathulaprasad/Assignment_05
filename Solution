#1.Perform the following tasks:
#  (a) Import mtcars dataset.
#  (b) Visualize your data using scatter plots
#  (c) Compute the Correlation between mpg and wt variables.

mtcars
head(mtcars)
library(ggplot2)
#Creating a Basic Scatterplot
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, y=mpg)) + geom_point()
#Add names to x and y axis
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=wt, y=mpg)) + geom_point() + scale_x_continuous("Weight of Car") + scale_y_continuous("Miles Per Gallon")

#Caluclate the correlation coefficient
cor(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg)


#2
#Perform the following:
#  (a) Define a normalized vector P.
#  (b) Define a normalized vector Q.
#  (c) Combine P and Q as matrix object. Please note that when defining a matrix from
#  vectors, the vectors should be combined as rows.
#  (d) Compute the Euclidean Distance with default parameters


# define a probability density function P
P <- 1:10/sum(1:10)
# define a probability density function Q
Q <- 20:29/sum(20:29)

# combine P and Q as matrix object
x <- rbind(P,Q)

# 3. Compute Manhattan distance and cosine similarity after performing (a),(b),(c) steps of
# Q.2.
